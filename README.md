# Inventory-System-in-C
The current inventory system doesn’t inform the company on low/out of stock items so when customers request this product there will be none available hence lost is sale and profit also its poor accuracy gives incorrect quotes to customers who indeed to buy products in bulk hence customer dissatisfaction lost in sale and the company’s reliability to customers will decrease.  The company’s inaccurate stock checks and report has also led them to a loss in revenue, time and margin-growth opportunities. By using a computerized inventory system, you can replace manual methods of inventory control and reduce the time, cost and effort of inventory management.
